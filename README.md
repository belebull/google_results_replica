# The Odin Project: HTML/CSS Assignment

*CSS Replica of Google Search Results Page*

In order to complete the HTML/CSS section of the Odin Project, students must create a replica of Google's homepage and search results page. (View project instructions [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css)). This is simply a CSS mockup of the webpage - there is no backend functionality. In addition to replicating the site, I utilized Page Speed Insights to optimize the page's performance.
